_Because the internet needs another blog (and at least it isn't a podcast)_

### The purpose of all this is twofold.

First, most of my data science toolkit has been self taught. I was enabled by the awesome content scattered across the internet. As I spend more time working on the pointy end of the data science industry I figured I might start to contribute back to the community that has selflessly offered so much already. 

Secondly, I build, tie together and deploy a crazy amount of projects but very rarely showcase them outside of my day to day work. Much of this work would be useful (to some degree) for others. For example - additions to the Microsoft Bot Framework (_that I had to write, thanks parent company Microsoft_), Presto wrappers and helper scripts plus some fun but often silly analyses. 

### A tiny introduction.

Formerly based in Sydney, Australia, I relocated to Singapore to run the analytics for our marketing solutions business for the Asia Pacific Region. This role is pretty cool because I get to work on everything between sales intelligence and strategy to client-facing analytics. I spend some time at the LinkedIn mothership in San Francisco and I try to get back to Australia as often as the tax office will let me. 

My academic background is in Information System and Economics. I was fortunate to get some awesome data heavy roles at Deloitte and Quantium. In 2016 I moved across to LinkedIn where I get to apply analytics at scale everyday. 

Technical skill wise I primarily work with Python, Spark, SQL (currently mostly across Spark-SQL and Presto) and I'm increasingly diving into Tensorflow for natural language understanding and sentiment analysis. 

If you've got questions, thoughts or comments ping me via one of my channels on the left hand rail.
